# atom-echo-phone

I had this idea for a while to implement a SIP phone in the
M5Stack [Atom Echo](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/atom/atomecho) programmable
"smart speaker." In my mind, it's entirely possible. It has a speaker, mic,
WiFi, and a button. I don't want to go through the trouble of working through
making it myself though, so I'll pass it to AI. We'll see how it does.
